# 👋 Hi, I'm @benjamincifuentes

👀 I'm interested in quality assurance, software testing, and continuous improvement of software quality.

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced automation testing techniques using Python, Selenium, and Postman. I'm also exploring new tools and frameworks for efficient bug tracking and resolution.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that focus on QA automation, testing frameworks, and improving software reliability. I'm eager to contribute to projects where I can apply my skills in manual and automated testing to enhance product quality.

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjacifuentes/) or check out my latest projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/benjaamincifuentes).

😀 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I have a knack for debugging and love finding those tricky bugs that nobody else can see. When I'm not testing, you might find me swimming or practicing yoga!
